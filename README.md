## Purpose
I uploaded this project for everyone who wants to learn Phaser. Download it and mondify as you want. 

## How it works

As a bunny,you have to try to get as many carrots as possible.But there is a challenge.The ground falls if you step in certain points, Beware! :warning:

The controls are simple: 

`Left arrow` key goes left.
`Right arrow` key goes right.
PRESS `SPACE BAR` TO JUMP!

## Requirements

To play phaser games you have to run a local web server 


There is a lot of programs that do this, particularly i use node`s http-server 

Installing:
```
npm install http-server -g 
```
Running:
```
http-server [project_folder_path]
```

Now just access   http://localhost:8080 and enjoy playing!


I made this game while i was learning phaser,you can do it too! :grinning:
